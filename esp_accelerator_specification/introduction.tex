\chapter{Introduction}

This document describes the signal-level protocol specification of an ESP
accelerator. The guide is intended for RTL designers who wish to implement a
native ESP accelerator using a hardware-description language, such as
SystemVerilog, or VHDL. Any accelerator that complies with the protocol
specification described in this guide can be integrated in ESP and leverage all
platform services through the {\em ESP accelerator socket}.

This document does not describe the {\em ESP third-party accelerator flow}. The
latter enables the seamless integration of an existing accelerator IP leveraging
an ARM AMBA open standard interface.
